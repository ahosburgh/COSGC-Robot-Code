Please include as comments at the top of your sketch:

// Your Name (so we know who to yell at :p)
// What component this sketch is testing
// What other components are required to make it work (if your testing a motor, what driver goes with it?) 
// What the expected outcome of the sketch is (This sketch turns an LED one for 1 second and off for 1 second)
// What we need to know about wiring the component up to the arduino (LED connected to Arduino pin 9)
// Anything else you can think of to make it easier for someone else opening your sketch to use it as reference and get up and running

In the sketch itself:

> Try to write an example of every action the component can take
ex:
> an LED would turn on and off
> a bluetooth module would send and recieve data
> a motor would spin in both directions AND we sould see how the speed is set (if possible)
